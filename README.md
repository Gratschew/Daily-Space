# Daily Space 
https://dailyspacex.herokuapp.com/

Daily Space is my personal project to display daily and historic astronomy pictures and statistics of how many humans are currently in space. The application was created using:
- NASA's API - Astronomy picture of the DayOpen 
- Notify's API - How Many People Are In Space Right Now

The web app is written in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/Node.js and a few lines of jQuery.

This project can be viewed in https://dailyspacex.herokuapp.com/
